# PacMen-Excersise-
This project creates a Pacman game utilizing HTML, Javascript, and four images of Pacman icons. You are presented with a page that has two buttons which are add Pacman and Start Game. Each time you are able to add a new Pacman icon that bounces around the web page at different speeds and directions. The amount of Pacmen you can add are limitless.
# How to run
Open the index.html in your web browser and start the game.
# Roadmap to improvement
I would add a stop button and more features such as ghosts and dots for pacman to eat along with a score for how far you get in the game.
